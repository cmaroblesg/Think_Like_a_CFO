# Corporate Finance Essentials
by IESE Business School

## About this Course
Corporate Finance Essentials will enable you to understand key financial issues related to companies, investors, and the interaction between them in the capital markets. By the end of this course you should be able to understand most of what you read in the financial press and use the essential financial vocabulary of companies and finance professionals.

## Syllabus
This Corporate Finance course is split up into six sessions. Each set of video lectures is complemented by a required reading (a teaching note or a book chapter) that is just as important as the video. The course material has been designed that you should first watch the video and then work through the required reading, in that order.

The topics we are going to cover in the six sessions are:
1. [Risk and Return](./Week2/README.md): In this session we will discuss some basic but essential financial concepts such as mean return, volatility, and beta. We will also learn how to apply them in order to assess the performance of selected equity markets over the last decade.
2. Correlation and Diversification: In this session we will discuss correlation, another essential financial tool, and its relationship to diversification, one of the bedrocks of modern finance. We will also apply this concept and assess the benefits of combining two different equity markets within a portfolio.
3. The CAPM and the Cost of Capital: In this session we will discuss how companies assess their cost of debt, their cost of equity, and ultimately their cost of capital. We will also discuss why this last concept is at the heart of many of the most important corporate decisions.
4. Estimating the Cost of Capital – An Application: In this session we will put to work all the concepts discussed in the previous session by estimating the cost of capital of a company. As usual, when putting theory into practice, a few complications arise and we will discuss how to deal with them.
5. Project Evaluation: In this session we will discuss how companies routinely decide whether or not to invest in projects. We will discuss the two tools most widely used for this purpose, NPV and IRR, and apply them to the evaluation of an investment opportunity.
6. Corporate Value Creation: In this session we will discuss EVA, a tool widely used to assess whether a company is creating or destroying value. We will also put this tool into practice by estimating the EVA of two companies.

All required teaching notes and book chapters accompanying each session are provided free of charge. We cannot provide the optional readings due to copyright restrictions.
