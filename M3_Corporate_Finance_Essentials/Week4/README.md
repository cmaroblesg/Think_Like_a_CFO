# The CAPM and the Cost of Capital

## Introduction
In this session we will discuss how companies assess their cost of debt, their cost of equity, and ultimately their cost of capital. We will also discuss why this last concept is at the heart of many of the most important corporate decisions.

## About this session
How does a company estimate the required return on its debt? And the required return on its equity? And, ultimately, its cost of capital? What is the usefulness of these concepts? We will discuss these and related issues in this third session.

## Readings
In this module there is a required reading and an optional reading. The required reading is available to you below. The optional reading is to deepen your knowledge but is not essential for the course completion. We cannot provide the optional reading on the site. The required reading is just as important as the videos and you are strongly advised to work through it, as it will help you understand the concepts discussed in the videos. Also, importantly, you should first watch the videos and then go over the required reading.

There is no assignment this module, so keep on reading the Appendix (‘Some Useful Excel Commands’) of [The Essential Financial Toolkit](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/corpfinance/lecture_slides/Week1/MOOC_Session%201_Reading%20All%20Weeks_ExcelCommands.pdf), at least the part related to the concepts discussed so far.
