# Risk and Return
## Introduction
Welcome to Session 1 In this session we will discuss some basic but essential financial concepts such as mean return, volatility, and beta. We will also learn how to apply them in order to assess the performance of selected equity markets over the last decade. The learning objective is to understand the basic, essential, and widely used financial concepts.

## Readings
For the first module, there are two required readings and an optional reading. All of the required readings for this session are available to you on the site. We cannot provide the optional readings due to copyright restrictions. The readings are based on my book, *The Essential Financial Toolkit*, whilst the optional readings are taken from my second book, *The FT Guide to Understanding Finance*. Both books will enhance your learning but are not necessary for completion of the course (if interested, please see "Syllabus" for details on how to purchase the books).

The required readings are just as important as the videos and you are strongly advised to work through them, as they will help you understand the concepts discussed in the videos. Also, importantly, you should first watch the videos and then go over the required readings.

There is no assignment this module, so this may be a good time to start reading the Appendix (‘Some Useful Excel Commands’) of [The Essential Financial Toolkit](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/corpfinance/lecture_slides/Week1/MOOC_Session%201_Reading%20All%20Weeks_ExcelCommands.pdf), at least the part related to the concepts discussed so far. I will refer to the Appendix, which is a required reading, throughout the course.

Starting from this week and for the rest of the course, we have also made available one additional file for you to use as you work through the sessions: [Data for Practicing Calculations](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/corpfinance/spreedsheet/Estrada-MOOC_Session1-Table.xlsx). Please use this file at any time so you can practice the calculations.
