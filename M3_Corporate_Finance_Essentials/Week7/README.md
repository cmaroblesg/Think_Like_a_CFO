# Corporate Value Creation
## Introduction
In this session we will discuss EVA, a tool widely used to assess whether a company is creating or destroying value. We will also put this tool into practice by estimating the EVA of two companies.

## About this session
How does a company assess whether it is creating or destroying value? What is the relationship between tools to measure value creation and managerial compensation? We will discuss these and related issues in this sixth and final session.
