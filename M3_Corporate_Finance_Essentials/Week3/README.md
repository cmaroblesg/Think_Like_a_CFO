# Correlation and Diversification

## Introduction
To understand diversification, an issue at the very heart of most investment decisions, and the role that correlation plays in determining the gains from diversification.

## About this session
What is a correlation? How is correlation related to diversification? Why is diversification at the heart of portfolio construction? This is a critical issue for investors and portfolio managers, and you simply cannot build a proper portfolio if you ignore them. We will discuss these and related issues in this second session.

## Readings
In this module there is one required reading and one optional reading. The required reading for this module is available to you on the site. We cannot provide the optional readings due to copyright restrictions.\
The required reading is taken from my book, *The Essential Financial Toolkit*, whilst the optional reading is taken from my second book, *The FT Guide to Understanding Finance*. Both books will enhance your learning but are not necessary for completion of the course (if interested, please see "Readings" in Module 1 for details on how to purchase the books).

The required reading is just as important as the videos and you are strongly advised to work through it, as it will help you understand the concepts discussed in the videos. Also, importantly, you should first watch the videos and then go over the required reading. Don't forget that if you wish to practice calculations, we have also made available one additional file for you to use as you work through the sessions: [Data for Practicing Calculations](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/corpfinance/spreedsheet/Estrada-MOOC_Session1-Table.xlsx). Please use this file at any time so you can practice the calculations.
