# Estimating the Cost of Capital - An Application
## Introduction
In this session we will put to work all the concepts discussed in the previous session by estimating the cost of capital of a company. As usual, when putting theory into practice, a few complications arise and we will discuss how to deal with them.

## About this session
Understanding the cost of capital and its components is essential, but can you put theory into practice? Can you estimate the cost of capital for a specific company? We will discuss how you can do this in this fourth session.  

## Readings
This week there is only one required reading. The required reading is provided to you on the site. The required reading is just as important as the videos and you are strongly advised to work through it, as it will help you understand the concepts discussed in the videos. Also, importantly, you should first watch the videos and then go over the required reading.

Also, make sure you go over the Appendix (‘Some Useful Excel Commands’) of [The Essential Financial Toolkit](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/corpfinance/lecture_slides/Week1/MOOC_Session%201_Reading%20All%20Weeks_ExcelCommands.pdf), at least the part related to the concepts discussed so far.
