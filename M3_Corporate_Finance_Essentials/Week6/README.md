# Project Evaluation
## Introduction
In this session we will discuss how companies routinely decide whether or not to invest in projects. We will discuss the two tools most widely used for this purpose, NPV and IRR, and apply them to the evaluation of an investment opportunity.

## About this session
How do companies separate the projects in which they should invest from those in which they should not? What are the essential tools for this task? We will discuss them and apply them to an investment project in this fifth session.  

## Readings
In this module there is a required reading and an optional reading. The required reading is available to you on the site. We cannot provide the optional readings due to copyright restrictions. The optional reading is taken from Professor Estrada’s book The FT Guide to Understanding Finance - the book will enhance your learning but is not necessary for completion of the course. The required reading listed below is just as important as the videos and you are strongly advised to work through it, as it will help you understand the concepts discussed in the videos. Also, importantly, you should first watch the videos and then go over the required reading.

In addition, keep on reading the Appendix (‘Some Useful Excel Commands’) of [The Essential Financial Toolkit](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/corpfinance/lecture_slides/Week1/MOOC_Session%201_Reading%20All%20Weeks_ExcelCommands.pdf), at least the part related to the concepts discussed so far.
