### 3. Content
This Financial Accounting course consists of four weekly sessions, each split into short video clips. Required readings (usually a teaching note) and some practice exercises will complement each lecture. The weekly course material has been designed so that you first watch the video and then work through the required reading, in that order.\
In the first sessions of the course, we will describe the mechanics of accounting: how economic events are recorded and summarized in financial statements.

* **Week 1:** [Introduction to Financial Accounting: The Balance Sheet](./Week1/README.md)
  * In this session you will  get an overview of the accounting process, understanding the road map from real business transactions to the summary financial reports. We will actually introduce the first and most important of this summary financial statements: the Balance Sheet. This financial report will tell us where the money is coming from and how it is being used in the firm.

* **Week 3:** [The Cash Flow Statement](./Week3/README.md)
  * Your business can be very profitable, but if it runs out of cash, it may go bankrupt. In this session we will introduce the Cash Flow Statement, a financial report that will help us understand liquidity, and how a company generates and consumes cash.

* **Week 4:** [Accrual Accounting](./Week4/README.md)  
  * The economic impact of events and transactions is recognized in the financial statements when the events and transactions occur, not when cash exchanges hands. This is called accrual accounting, as opposed to cash accounting, in which you would only recognize cash transactions. In this session we will discuss the fundamental implications of accrual accounting, such as the necessary introduction of subjective estimates.
