## Syllabus
This course picks up where **Corporate Finance Essentials** left, addressing other corporate finance issues not addressed in the previous course, such as market efficiency, bonds, stocks, capital structure, and dividend policy.

### Content:

1. A Look Back and A Look Ahead. In this first session we will first summarize the most important messages of all the topics discussed in Corporate Finance Essentials, and then introduce the topics we will discuss in this follow-up course.
2. [Market Efficiency](./Week2/README.md). In the second session we will discuss several issues related to the bedrock concept of market efficiency, one of the cornerstones of modern finance, including its meaning and important implications for investors.
3. [Bonds](./Week3/README.md). In the third session we will discuss some introductory issues related to bonds, such as terminology, issuers, and types of bonds, as well as their return (yield to maturity) and default risk, including a brief discussion of other sources of risk.
4. [Stocks](./Week4/README.md). In the fourth session we will discuss the valuation of stocks through the method of relative valuation (multiples), including the most widely-used multiples and the issues an analyst needs to deal with in order to use multiples properly for valuation.
5. [Capital Structure](./Week5/README.md). In the fifth session we will discuss the sources of financing companies use to obtain capital for their projects, a quantitative way to determine the optimal mix of debt and equity, and some relevant qualitative variables.
6. [Dividend Policy](./Week6/README.md). In the sixth session we will discuss two critical decisions all companies need to make, whether to pay dividends, and if so how much; we will also discuss the variables that must be considered when deciding a dividend policy.

All required teaching notes and book chapters accompanying each session are provided free of charge. We cannot provide the optional readings due to copyright restrictions.

Just all corporate finance textbooks cover the issues discussed in this course. For more general references in finance, you can take a look at two of Prof. Javier Estrada's books, the first which is more basic, easier to read, and written as dialogues between a professor and his class; and the second which is very applied and practical but also more technical and comprehensive.
* The Essential Financial Toolkit: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Finance But Were Afraid to Ask. Palgrave Macmillan, 2011.
* The FT Guide to Understanding Finance: A No-Nonsense Companion to Financial Tools and Techniques. FT Prentice Hall, 2011.

These books are not required for the course. Both can be purchased online and doing so is the responsibility of each student. These books will enhance your learning but are not necessary for completion of the course.
* The required readings are taken from Professor EstradaÂ´s book, The Essential Financial Toolkit: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Finance But Were Afraid To Ask (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).

Additionally, professor Estrada recommends these two books:
* Applied Corporate Finance. Aswath Damodaran, Wiley; 4th Edition (October 2014)
* Corporate Finance. The Core. Berk Demarzo, Pearson; 4th Edition (July 2016)
