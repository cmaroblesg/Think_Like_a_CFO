# Finance for Managers
#### by IESE Business School

## About this Course
When it comes to numbers, there is always more than meets the eye.  In operational finance, you will learn how to read the “story” that the balance sheet and income statement tells about the company’s operations. The insights you gain from this “financial story” will then become a tool for short-term decision-making at the top management level relating to current assets, current liabilities and the management of working capital. Finally, by the end of the course you will understand the financial consequences of managerial decisions on operations, marketing, etc.

## Course Overview & Syllabus
### 1. Introduction
Operational Finance is about much more than numbers. Exactly what the numbers on a balance sheet or P&L statement really mean depends a great deal on each company’s unique context: What do they sell? Who are their customers and suppliers? Where is the firm located? What should you expect the numbers to look like based on a company’s industry?\
In this course, you will learn how to take all of these and other factors into consideration in order to make financing decisions. By the end of the four weeks, you will learn how to apply a decision-making framework to develop sound solutions to financing problems.

## 2. Learning Objectives
The goal of this course is provide learners with a methodology through which they can analyze a company’s financial situation and develop sound financing decisions accordingly.\
If you are enrolled in IESE’s Foundations of Management Specialization, this course will build upon what you learned about the balance sheet and P&L in Accounting: Making Sound Decisions. (Please note, however, the accounting course is not a pre-requisite for Finance: Building a Robust Business.)\
At the end of the course you should be able to:
*  Analyze and interpret financial statements
*  Execute financial forecasts
*  Diagnose financial problems
*  Develop action plans to resolve financial problems

## 3. Content
Operational Finance: Building a Robust Business consists of four weekly sessions, each split into short video clips. Required readings (cases) and some practice exercises will complement each lecture. Lectures will be based on IESE’s Polypanel case which is available to you on the course site. The weekly course material has been designed so that you read the corresponding section of the case before you watch the weekly video clips.

 ### [Week 1 - Financial Analysis](./Week1/README.md)
In this session you will get an overview of how to conduct a basic analysis of financial statements (the balance sheet and P&L) and the different items that compose them.

### [Week 2 - Operational Ratios and Forecasting](./Week2/README.md)
In this session we will discuss how the ratios shed light on a firm’s strengths and weaknesses. You will also gain insights into how we can use these ratios to develop the forecasting needed for decision making.

### [Week 3 - Diagnosis and Action Plan](./Week3/README.md)
In this session, you will learn how to diagnose company problems and develop an action plan to address them.

### [Week 4 – Sensitivity Analysis, NFO Revisited, and Building up the ROE](./Week4/READEME.md)
In this final week we will talk about how conclusions change with changes in key variables, we will complete the concept of NFO, we will develop the DuPont analysis, and do a final short game.

## 4. Methodology and Evaluation
The course consists of four sessions of 45-60 minutes each. Each session builds on prior sessions. The course is self-contained and assumes you have no financial background at all.\
Performance in the course will be evaluated on the basis of four quizzes, to be released each week. These quizzes will ask you to apply the concepts and issues discussed and help you to assess your understanding of them.\
There will be a teaching assistant monitoring the forums and answering some of the questions you may have during the course. Please note, however, that the due to the massive expected audience, the TA may not be able to answer all the questions asked.

## 5. Readings
Required readings and assignments will be made available for you on the platform:
Case: “Polypanel: Financing Growth”
Prep Sheets for case and other exhibits and supplements
